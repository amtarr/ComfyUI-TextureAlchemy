## What is TextureAlchemy?

TextureAlchemy is a complete workflow suite for ComfyUI that transforms ordinary images into professional physically-based rendering (PBR) materials using AI-powered alchemy.

Like an alchemist turning lead into gold, TextureAlchemy turns simple images into complete material sets ready for game engines, 3D software, and rendering pipelines.

Complete PBR Material
├─ Albedo (base color)
├─ Normal (surface detail)
├─ Roughness (surface finish)
├─ Metallic (metal/dielectric)
├─ AO (ambient occlusion)
├─ Height (displacement)
└─ Curvature (wear/damage maps)
